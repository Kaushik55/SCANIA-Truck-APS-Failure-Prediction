# SCANIA-Truck-APS-Failure-Prediction
Air Pressure System (APS) in trucks generates pressurized air that is used for various functions of trucks such as braking and gear changes. Lot of money is spent on un-necessary checks done by service person on APS system in trucks, which can be prevented by developing a machine learning model that can predict the failure of component in APS
